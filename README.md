**Futurense US Pathway Program Analysis and Machine Learning Project**

Overview:
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and machine learning project focused on the Futurense US Pathway Program. The project aims to identify key insights, enhance program performance, and build predictive models using real-world data. Additionally, visualizations and actionable recommendations are included to address core business challenges.

**Repository Structure**
The repository is organized into the following sections:
1. Datasets
Raw Data: Contains the original datasets used for analysis, including lead details, conversion rates, and marketing channel performance.
Processed Data: Includes cleaned and preprocessed datasets used for machine learning models and dashboard development.
2. Project Codes
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Scripts for preprocessing, handling missing data, and feature engineering.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of predictive models to analyze key performance metrics and predict outcomes, such as lead-to-token conversion probabilities.
PowerBI Dashboard Integration: Scripts used for data extraction and transformation for dashboard visualizations.
3. Reports
Detailed analysis reports summarizing the findings, including key insights on conversion rates, marketing channels, and agent performance.
Statistical analysis of missing data (MCAR, MAR, and MNAR), including chi-square test results and correlations.
4. Presentation (PPT)
A presentation summarizing the project objectives, methodology, key findings, and recommendations.
Visual slides from the PowerBI dashboard are included to provide insights into audience engagement and program performance.
5. PowerBI Dashboard
An interactive dashboard offering visual insights into:
Conversion rates by marketing channel.
Agent and counselor performance analysis.
Time-to-payment trends.
Lead-to-token conversion patterns.

Key Objectives:
Audience Engagement: Analyze the effectiveness of various marketing channels and recommend strategies to improve engagement.
Agent and Counselor Analysis: Evaluate performance metrics to identify high and low performers, with actionable recommendations for improvement.
